## Progress Check / Stand Up
Each week, I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by including a **Stand-Up**. A "stand-up" is when I take the time to briefly report out on the following...

1. **Accomplishments** - What I worked on this past week
2. **Challenges** - Any challenges I may have (and how I am addressing those challenges)
3. **Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next 

<br>

## Month 1

**Week 1**: This week I began researching and planning an application. Some of my challenges were trying to find a 'problem solving' project idea. Through many iterations of project ideas I was able to find an idea that would meet my project requirements. The next thing I plan to prioritize is creating a mock up of my project.

**Week 2**: This week I began creating wireframes and deciding on how my application would look. This week allowd me to let out some of my creative side. The only challenge this week was trying to figure out what the key features of the app would look like and how they would flow within the application.   

**Week 3**: This week I began creating the components for the application based of the previous weeks prototype. Some of the challenges this week were breaking down the components and what components would be stateful. Once I created my components I began creating my pages and routes.

**Week 4**: This week I continued working on my previous weeks work. I spent a good amount of time fixing conflicting issues with components and routes. I also spent time researching how I would manage state and how I would implement redux if needed.

## Month 2

**Week 1**: For the second month week 1 I worked on finishing up the components and pages from month 1 week 4. Here i started adding dummy data to the components to see how it will function once the api is implemented. As for state management I still need to figure out how I am going to implement redux.

**Week 2**: This week began creating my backend. I created created all of my models and the database using sequelize. After having created my models I began creating my routes and controllers to test those models and verify associations were set up properly. My next priority is to complete the remainding routes/controllers and begin to implement auth using jwt.

**Week 3**: This week I began connecting my API to the frontend. I started with connecting the auth login/signup routes and continued with the private routes once a login with jwt was implemented. My next priority is to complete the rest of the connecting of the api and front end and begin to finalize the project.
