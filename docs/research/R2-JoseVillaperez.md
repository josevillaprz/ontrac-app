## Wireframes
Wireframes offer the basic foundation of which a web app will look like. Wireframes define the layout and sizes of elements to be used in your site.

* Do your research
* Black and white low fidelity design. Have no color, font choices, or designs.
* Wireframes allow a client to see how features will function without the unnecessary jargon.
* Usability of a site is much more apparent and issues can be caught early on instead of later when the design is all fleshed out.
* With the amount of devices it is important to not only think about desktop but those other devices when creating wireframes.
