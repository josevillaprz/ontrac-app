## Use Case Testing
Use case testing is a testing technique that helps identify test scenarios of the applications behaviour. 

* **Sunny day Use Cases:** The primary case that is most likely to occure when everuthing goes well.
* **Rainy day Use Cases:** list of edge cases( accidental features of the requirements)

#### Elements of a use case test.

1. **Brief description:** A brief description explaining the case.

2. **Actor:** Users that are involved in Use Cases Actions.

3. **Precondition:** Conditions to be Satisfied before the case begins.

4. **Basic Flow:** ‘Basic Flow’ or ‘Main Scenario’ is the normal workflow in the system. It is the flow of transactions done by the Actors on accomplishing their goals. When the actors interact with the system, as it’s the normal workflow, there won’t be any error and the Actors will get the expected output.

5. **Alternate flow:** Apart from the normal workflow, a system can also have an ‘Alternate workflow’. This is the less common interaction done by a user with the system.

6. **Exception flow:** The flow that prevents a user from achieving the goal.

7. **Post Conditions:** The conditions that need to be checked after the case is completed.

## Loading Screens
Loading screens are important because it communicates with the user that their request is being processed. If no communication occurs back to the user the user may think something is not working. This can often lead to a bad UX.

* loading screens should be shown as least as possible. Solve content loading problems first
* Give a time estimation.
* Explain why they need to wait
* use the loading time to emphasize your brand

<br>

## Success Messages
Providing success feedback to the user is important because it lets the user know that what they are trying to achieve was completed.

* Shouldnt be over done. can be simple
* must provide clear information


<br>

## Empty States
Empty states are used to let the user know that there is no data to display. This impoves user experience because it lets the user know what is going on and why, instead of displaying a blank screen 

* Empty states should let the user know why it is a empty state
* Empty states should have useful purpose
* Can provide starter content or provide action steps that the user can take

## Error message placement
Placement of your errors can either make or break your form UX. Errors should be where the user can easily see them and associate them with where the errors occured.

* Placing all the errors at the top forces the user to recall each error for its respective field.
* Placing the errors inline with the form input better displays what error is associated to what field
* studies show users prefer errors to the right of the input field.
* for mobile forms error messages are best below the field.
