## Clean Code
When a feature is completed it is important to go back and 'clean up' the code. This can be refactoring code, removing stuff that isnt used, or removing commented out code. Doing this makes your code much more easier to read and maintain.

* reduces the frequency of changes on a pull request review.
* clean code should be **DRY** ( Don't Repeat Yourself ).
* Dont comment obvious things


## 80/20
The 80/20 rule states that 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes. 

* Helpful in determining where you can focus your efforts to maximize your output
* Focusing on the top priorities yields the best results

## Creating a good README.md
The readme file is usually the first file a person will see when checking out your project in your repo. A well documented readme will let the user know what is in the project and what they can expect to see when checking it out. Its important to set this up as user-friendly as able.

* Even if the code is for yourself, chances are you may come back and having that will be useful for understanding what you were doing.
* Well written readme's can help jr devs as the repo can be used as part of your portfolio.

## About page
The about page gives the user insight into the brand and the people that make that brand come to life.

* Include things more about what the brand is and stands for as opposed to what the service or product does.
* Think of including things like: 
	* how it started
	* what makes it unique
	* brand values
	* why costumers choose you
	* behind the scenes stuff
	* where you are
* have a good about page solidifies your brand image
* Have a redirect or next action towards the bottom of the page. dont just leave them sitting at the bottom.
